# Relay (Vite + React PWA)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build && npm run preview   # production build (needed to test PWA install)
```

## Privy (auth + wallets)

1. Create an app at https://dashboard.privy.io and copy the **App ID**.
2. `cp .env.example .env` and set `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID=<your app id>`. Restart `npm run dev`.
3. In the Privy dashboard:
   - **Allowed origins**: add `http://localhost:5173` and your production/preview domains.
   - **Login methods**: enable **Email** (used by the in-app login screen). Passkey, social, SMS and WhatsApp
     are optional and appear under "More sign-in options". SMS outside the US/Canada and WhatsApp need the Scale plan.
   - **Embedded wallets**: enable Ethereum and Solana (created automatically on first login).
4. Backend: send `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` (see `src/lib/http.ts`) and verify the JWT with Privy; use its `sub` as the user id.

With no app ID the app runs in **demo mode**: no login, placeholder wallets. State is stored per user in `localStorage` (a stand-in for your API).

### Dev failure switches
`localStorage['relay-mock-quote' | 'relay-mock-submit' | 'relay-mock-order' | 'relay-mock-pools']` — see `src/lib/mock.ts`.
